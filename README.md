# STAT 218 Final Project

This repository contains Amuna, YiJun, and Grace's final project for **STAT 218: Statistical Learning**.

### Research Question:
Can individual attitudes toward democracy, institutions, and freedom predict whether someone is likely to participate in a protest?

### Data
The data is from 2023 (post-protest), from the Latinobarómetro, a regional public opinion survey conducted annually across 18 Latin American countries. The survey covers a wide range of political, economic, and social topics and includes a nationally representative sample of approximately 1,200 respondents in Chile.

### Introduction
In 2019 after the government decided to increase the per metro fare by four percent, an estimated 1.2 million Chileans gathered in Santiago to protest. Although this increase is equivalent to only thirty pesos, or approximately four U.S. cents, it triggered the largest-scale protest in the Chile’s democratic history. How did a booming, high-income nation celebrated as a successful economic model, face such widespread intense public discontent over a relatively minor policy change? While mass mobilization signals public willingness to hold authorities accountable and speaks to a society where civic engagement is alive, large-scale protests can also reflect a deeper disconnect
between citizens and the state (especially when they occur amid strong economic performance). We are interested in exploring who participates in protests, and whether beliefs about democracy, trust, freedom, and both personal and national economic outlook, influence protest participation.

### Conclusion
Our findings suggest that perceptions of the economy are particularly strong predictors of Chileans’ likelihood to protest, based on results from both random forest and logistic regression models.
